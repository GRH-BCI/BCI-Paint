# Development Plan

## Specifications
**Language:** Python
**Libraries:** Pygame

## Steps
1.	Research and select a language to develop the application with.
2.	Research and select the main libraries within the language that will be needed.
3.	Research other paint applications written in the selected language.
4.	Determine what features would be nice to have in a paint application.
5.	Determine how and if the user can be given choice for each feature. Determine the limitations of BCI and if necessary, simplify or reduce the features.
6.	Create a mock-up of the user interface.
7.	Develop a prototype paint program that works with keyboard input.
8.	Integrate the program with the BCI software.
9.	Test the program and refine the features as necessary.
